# NFT TICKET SYSTEM

## STEP 1: SETTING UP THE REACT APP

First, we need to create a new React application. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project, and run the following command:

`npx create-react-app nft-ticket-system`

This will create a new folder `nft-ticket-system` with all the necessary files and dependencies for a React application.

## STEP 2: INSTALL AXIOS

We'll be using Axios to make HTTP requests to the Blockspan API. Navigate into your new project folder and install Axios:

`cd nft-ticket-system` `npm install axios`

## STEP 3: CREATE A NEW COMPONENT

In the `src` directory, create a new file `NFTTicketSystem.js`. This will be our main component for the NFT Ticket System.

## STEP 4: WRITING THE COMPONENT
